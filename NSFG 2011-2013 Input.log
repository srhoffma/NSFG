8     | SAS SETUP SECTIONS ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ASCII VERSION OF THIS DATA
9     | COLLECTION.  THESE SECTIONS ARE LISTED BELOW:
10    |
11    | PROC FORMAT:  CREATES USER-DEFINED FORMATS FOR THE VARIABLES. FORMATS
12    | REPLACE ORIGINAL VALUE CODES WITH VALUE CODE DESCRIPTIONS. ONLY
13    | VARIABLES WITH USER-DEFINED FORMATS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION.
14    |
15    | DATA:  BEGINS A SAS DATA STEP AND NAMES AN OUTPUT SAS DATA SET.
16    |
17    | INFILE:  IDENTIFIES THE INPUT FILE TO BE READ WITH THE INPUT STATEMENT.
18    | USERS MUST REPLACE THE "DATA-FILENAME" WITH A FILENAME SPECIFYING THE
19    | DIRECTORY ON THE USER'S COMPUTER SYSTEM IN WHICH THE DOWNLOADED AND
20    | UNZIPPED DATA FILE IS PHYSICALLY LOCATED (E.G., "C:\TEMP\DATA.DAT").
21    |
22    | INPUT:  ASSIGNS THE NAME, TYPE, DECIMAL SPECIFICATION (IF ANY), AND
23    | SPECIFIES THE BEGINNING AND ENDING COLUMN LOCATIONS FOR EACH VARIABLE
24    | IN THE DATA FILE.
25    |
26    | LABEL:  ASSIGNS DESCRIPTIVE LABELS TO ALL VARIABLES. VARIABLE LABELS
27    | AND VARIABLE NAMES MAY BE IDENTICAL FOR SOME VARIABLES.
28    |
29    | MISSING VALUE NOTE:  TO MAINTAIN THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF MISSING CODES,
30    | USERS MAY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SAS MISSING VALUES (THE LETTERS
31    | A-Z OR AN UNDERSCORE PRECEDED BY A PERIOD).
32    |
33    | AN EXAMPLE OF A STANDARD MISSING VALUE RECODE:
34    |
35    |   IF (RELATION = 98 OR RELATION = 99) THEN RELATION = .;
36    |
37    | THE SAME EXAMPLE USING SPECIAL MISSING VALUE RECODES:
38    |
39    |    IF RELATION = 98 THEN RELATION = .A;
40    |    IF RELATION = 99 THEN RELATION = .B;
41    |
42    | FORMAT:  ASSOCIATES THE FORMATS CREATED BY THE PROC FORMAT STEP WITH
43    | THE VARIABLES NAMED IN THE INPUT STATEMENT.
44    |
45    | USERS SHOULD MODIFY THIS SETUP FILE TO SUIT THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.
46    | To include these sections in the final SAS setup, users should remove the
47    | SAS comment indicators from the desired section(s).
