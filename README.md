National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) Code

The 2011-2013 NSFG data and documentation can be downloaded here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm 

The Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids (SELF) enrolled black women ages 23-35 circa 2011. https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/epi/studies/self/index.cfm

SELF excluded women with a prior diagnosis of uterine fibroids. 

We wanted to know, how many black women in this age range had a prior diagnosis of uterine fibroids that they were aware of?

NSFG asked, "Has a doctor or other medical care provider ever told you that you had fibroid tumors or myomas in your uterus?"

Variable UF is described here: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsradmin/nsfg/variable/615670?studyNumber=9998

National estimate for black women ages 23-35 was 5.87%	(95% CI: 4.32, 7.42).

Also included is output from our inquiry into current use estimates for hormonal contraceptives in black women ages 23-35.

We found that current HC use by type was similar to what we observed in SELF enrollees. 

The SAS code in this repository contains the code to produce both the UF estimates and the current HC use estimates.
